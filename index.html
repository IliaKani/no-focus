          <p class="card first-card">
            It is especially difficult to concentrate when there are many tasks and all of them are important. Where's the legendary multitasking when you need it? (and all the hiring managers of this world)? But the fact is that it simply does not exist. Researchers <a class="link link-style" href="https://dana.org/article/multicosts-of-multitasking/" target="_blank">found out</a>, that it is difficult for the brain to concentrate even on two things at the same time. And when several important tasks come into focus, the body panics and releases cortisol and adrenaline - “stress hormones”. Because of this, we work inattentively: we make mistakes and get tired quickly.

          <h3 class="accent-text title-decor title-margin header-dophamine">Dopamine</h3>
          <p class="card second-card">
            Everything is clear with stress hormones, but then it gets even more interesting. The exact opposite of stress, dopamine, is also involved in our inability to concentrate. This substance is involved in the brain's reward system. What does he have to do with it? We are often distracted from an important task by something more “pleasant” for the brain. For example, look at likes on social networks. At this time, dopamine is released - and we feel pleasure. It turns out to be a vicious circle: the more distracted you are, the more pleasure you get.

        <h2 class="main-points">What reduces concentration?</h2>
        <h3 class="accent-text multitask title-decor title-margin">Multitasking</h3>
        <p class="card-multitask card">
          How can concentration decrease due to... concentration? Any stressful situation (and a dramatically changing world in general) forces our brain to constantly “scan” the environment for danger. For example, reading the news instead of working. But it is impossible to be collected all the time. Concentration is a muscle, and it can fail if you don't give it a rest.

        <h3 class="accent-text eat title-decor title-margin">Food</h3>
        <p class="card-eat card">
          “Fast carbohydrates” - sugar, white bread, sweets - instantly deliver energy to the brain and help it work better. But this energy leaves as quickly as it comes. As a result, we end up on a “carbohydrate swing”: as soon as the effect of “fast carbohydrates” ends, we feel tired and drowsy. And we want even more fast carbohydrates.
        </p>
        <h3 class="accent-text devices title-decor title-margin">Gadgets</h3>
        <p class="card-devices card">
          Yes, yes, this is the same situation when there is a code on the laptop screen, a podcast in the headphones, and a video with funny ducklings on the computer in the background. As a result, the brain tries to switch from one task to another - and simply cannot. And to return to a state of full concentration, a person needs on average 20 minutes. So it turns out that the more time we spend on gadgets, the more time it then takes to get back to work.

          <h3 class="accent-text title-decor content-subtitle">5 simple (not really) tips</h3>
          <h4 class="subtitle-text title-decor title-margin">Imagine the sky and clouds</h4>
          <p class="card">
            Or leaves in a stream. It's all about light meditation, which helps you calm down. After all, often it is anxious thoughts about complex tasks that prevent these complex tasks from being done. At such moments, you can close your eyes and imagine that the clear sky is you, and the clouds are disturbing thoughts. And no matter how many there are, the clear sky will always be somewhere there, behind the clouds, and will not go anywhere. This exercise will help you bring yourself back to the present moment rather than worrying about potential problems in the future.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subtitle-text title-decor title-margin">Turn on the music</h4>
          <p class="card">
            But not just any one, and not your favorite one. A loved one can be associated with strong positive emotions, which are also very distracting. Quiet, calm, moderately rhythmic will do. You can even try turning on a playlist with “white noise” or neuromusic.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subtitle-text title-decor title-margin">Take a walk</h4>
          <p class="card">
            Or even go for a run. It’s better to find a park or a forest: one experiment <a class="link link-style" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494415000328" target="_blank">showed</a>, that contemplation of nature increases concentration, while after viewing city landscapes it, on the contrary, decreases. You can combine a walk with physical exercise or running - this will deliver even more oxygen to the brain and make it work better. But a simple twenty-minute walk is also a great option.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subtitle-text title-decor title-margin">eat well</h4>
          <p class="card">
            We are not your grandmother, but this is really important. Choose foods that prevent blood sugar spikes. For example, high in fiber: vegetables, berries, legumes (chickpeas, lentils, beans), brown rice, whole grain wheat bread.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subtitle-text title-decor title-margin">Read</h4>
          <p class="card">
            Real paper books. This really helps with concentration: it only takes a few minutes or even seconds to read a post on a social network. But an interesting book can captivate you for several hours and greatly trains focused attention.
